Anyone who, just like me, don't know anything about homebridge
but still want a straightforward way to communicate with your own home-made Raspberry Pi blinds controller. 

### How to use it

The installation instructions differs depending on how you installed homebridge.

Usually, it's something like _"add this to your homebridge's `install.sh`"_
